CALMCOVE - JAPANESE ZEN INSPIRED DESIGN SYSTEM SPECIFICATION
================================================================================

SECTION 1: GLOBAL CONCEPT AND VISUAL SYSTEM
================================================================================

JAPANESE ZEN PHILOSOPHY IN INTERFACE DESIGN
-------------------------------------------
The entire website expresses Japanese zen principles through intentional restraint, 
balanced asymmetry, and mindful spacing. Every element breathes with generous 
negative space. Visual hierarchy emerges from subtle contrast rather than bold 
statements. The interface feels calm, focused, and uncluttered - like a carefully 
arranged zen garden where each element has purpose and placement.

COLOR RHYTHM AND PALETTE
-------------------------
Base Palette (Cool Neutrals):
- Primary Surface: Deep charcoal gray (almost black, with slight blue undertone)
- Secondary Surface: Medium charcoal gray (lighter than primary, maintains depth)
- Tertiary Surface: Soft slate gray (for elevated content areas)
- Accent Primary: Cool blue-gray (calm, focused, not electric - think misty morning sky)
- Accent Secondary: Soft teal-gray (for interactive states, subtle and calming)
- Text Primary: Off-white (slight warm tint to avoid harshness)
- Text Secondary: Medium gray (60% opacity of primary text)
- Text Tertiary: Light gray (40% opacity, for hints and labels)
- Border: Very subtle gray (10-15% opacity, barely visible but defines edges)
- Success: Soft sage green (muted, not vibrant)
- Warning: Warm amber-gray (gentle, not alarming)
- Error: Soft rose-gray (calm, not jarring)

The palette maintains low saturation throughout. Colors feel muted, sophisticated, 
and never compete with the cybercity background. All surfaces use solid colors 
with subtle opacity variations - no glassmorphism, no blur effects.

TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM
-----------------
Primary Font: Inter (sans-serif, modern, clean, excellent readability)
- Weights: Regular (400), Medium (500), Semibold (600), Bold (700)
- Primary use: Body text, labels, buttons, interface elements

Display Font: Inter (same family, different weights for hierarchy)
- Weights: Light (300) for large numbers, Medium (500) for headings
- Primary use: Timer displays, large numbers, main headings

Font Scale:
- Display XL: 64px (timer numbers, hero text)
- Display L: 48px (large headings)
- Heading 1: 32px (panel titles)
- Heading 2: 24px (section headers)
- Heading 3: 20px (subsection headers)
- Body Large: 16px (primary body text)
- Body: 14px (standard interface text)
- Body Small: 12px (labels, hints, metadata)
- Caption: 11px (timestamps, fine print)

Line Height: Generous spacing - 1.6 for body, 1.4 for headings, 1.2 for display
Letter Spacing: Slight negative tracking for large text (-0.02em), normal for body

SPACING SCALE (8px base unit)
------------------------------
- 4px: xs (tight spacing, icon padding)
- 8px: sm (minimal gaps)
- 12px: md (comfortable gaps)
- 16px: base (standard spacing)
- 24px: lg (section spacing)
- 32px: xl (major section breaks)
- 48px: 2xl (panel padding)
- 64px: 3xl (large margins, breathing room)

CORNER RADII
------------
- 4px: Small elements (badges, tags, small buttons)
- 8px: Standard elements (buttons, inputs, cards)
- 12px: Panels, larger cards
- 16px: Major panels, modals
- 24px: Large containers, main content areas
- Full: Pills, rounded buttons, circular elements

SHADOW PHILOSOPHY
-----------------
Shadows are extremely subtle, creating gentle elevation without drama.
- Level 1: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1) - barely perceptible, for subtle separation
- Level 2: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.12) - light elevation for cards
- Level 3: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.15) - moderate elevation for panels
- Level 4: 0 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.2) - significant elevation for modals

No colored shadows, no glows, no dramatic effects. Shadows are purely functional 
for depth perception.

ICON STYLE
----------
Icons are minimal, line-based, with consistent stroke width (1.5-2px). They use 
the same cool neutral palette as text. Icons are slightly smaller than text to 
maintain visual balance. All icons maintain consistent visual weight and style 
throughout the interface.

NEGATIVE SPACE RULES
--------------------
- Panels have minimum 48px padding on all sides
- Elements within panels have 16-24px spacing between them
- Sections are separated by 32px minimum
- Left sidebar icons have 12px spacing between them
- Content areas breathe with generous margins
- Never crowd elements - if in doubt, add more space

CYBERCITY BACKGROUND INTEGRATION
---------------------------------
The cybercity background is high visibility but carefully controlled:
- Background layer: Full bleed, 100% opacity, positioned center
- Overlay layer: Dark gradient overlay (black at 40-50% opacity) applied from 
  top to bottom, slightly stronger at top, lighter at bottom
- Animation: Subtle parallax effect - background moves at 0.5x speed relative 
  to scroll (if any scrolling occurs), creating gentle depth without distraction
- Content layering: All UI elements sit above the overlay with sufficient 
  contrast to remain readable
- The background should feel present and atmospheric but never compete with 
  foreground content

UNIFIED AESTHETIC RULES
-----------------------
All surfaces use solid colors with subtle opacity. No transparency effects, 
no blur, no glassmorphism. Panels have defined edges with subtle borders. 
Content areas use the tertiary surface color to create gentle elevation. 
Interactive elements have clear hover states using the accent colors. All 
transitions are smooth and moderate in speed (200-300ms). Nothing feels rushed 
or jarring. The entire interface maintains a calm, focused atmosphere.


SECTION 2: UNIFIED LAYOUT FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

GLOBAL LAYOUT STRUCTURE
------------------------
The layout uses a fixed viewport approach - no scrolling on the main container. 
All content fits within the viewport or appears in overlay panels. The layout 
is divided into distinct zones that work together harmoniously.

MAIN SHELL WIREFRAME
---------------------
Top Zone (Fixed, 80px height):
- Left: Branding (CalmCove logo/text, minimal, top-left corner)
- Right: Clock widget and account icon (top-right corner)
- Both fade on idle after 5 minutes

Left Zone (Fixed, 80px width):
- Vertical sidebar with icon buttons
- Icons: Background selector, Focus mode, Pomodoro, Alarm, Tasks, Settings
- Icons are always visible, arranged vertically with 12px spacing
- Sidebar positioned 24px from left edge, vertically centered
- Icons fade on idle but remain accessible

Center Zone (Flexible):
- Main workspace area
- Cybercity background visible here with dark overlay
- Content panels appear centered or positioned as needed
- No fixed content - area breathes with negative space

Right Zone (Reserved):
- Currently unused, maintains balance
- Future expansion space if needed

Bottom Zone (Fixed, 80px height):
- Music player bar
- Centered horizontally, 24px from bottom
- Fades on idle but remains accessible

PANEL POSITIONING STRATEGY
--------------------------
When panels open (Pomodoro, Tasks, Alarm, Settings):
- They appear centered in the viewport initially
- They are draggable to any position
- They can be resized (mixer panel)
- They maintain minimum distances from viewport edges (24px padding)
- Multiple panels can be open simultaneously
- Panels use the tertiary surface color with subtle border
- No backdrop blur or dimming overlay - panels are self-contained

INTEGRATION OF FEATURE MODULES
-------------------------------
Pomodoro Timer:
- Opens as centered panel, 400px wide, auto-height
- Can be dragged anywhere
- Integrates seamlessly with sidebar icon
- Timer display is large and prominent (64px numbers)
- Controls are minimal and clear

Alarm System:
- Opens as centered panel, 450px wide
- List view with creation form
- Each alarm is a card within the panel
- Recurrence options use chip-style selectors
- Alarms integrate with sidebar icon

Task Manager:
- Opens as centered panel, 450px wide, max-height 600px
- Scrollable task list within panel
- Task creation form at top
- Tasks are cards with checkboxes
- Completed tasks fade but remain visible
- Integrates with sidebar icon

All three modules share the same visual language: solid surfaces, subtle borders, 
generous padding, cool neutral colors, and clear typography hierarchy.

- Cards: 12px
- Panels: 16px
- Large containers: 24px
- Pills, rounded buttons: Full (20px+)

No sharp corners except where intentionally minimal. Rounded corners feel 
softer and more approachable, aligning with zen principles.

SPACING PHILOSOPHY
------------------
Generous negative space is key to zen aesthetic:
- Never crowd elements
- Minimum spacing: 8px between related elements
- Standard spacing: 16px between sections
- Large spacing: 32px between major sections
- Breathing room: 48px padding in panels
- If in doubt, add more space

Vertical Rhythm:
- Consistent spacing creates visual rhythm
- Elements align to 8px grid
- Text has generous line height (1.6 for body)
- Headings have appropriate spacing above and below

SUBTLE TEXTURES (IF NEEDED)
---------------------------
If textures are used, they must be extremely subtle:
- Noise texture: 2-3% opacity maximum
- Grain: Very fine, barely perceptible
- Patterns: Minimal, low contrast
- Purpose: Add depth without distraction
- Never compete with content

In most cases, solid colors with subtle opacity variations are preferred over 
textures. The cybercity background provides enough visual interest.

INTEGRATING CYBERCITY BACKGROUND
---------------------------------
Background Strategy:
- Full bleed, high visibility
- Dark overlay (40-50% black) for readability
- Overlay is slightly stronger at top, lighter at bottom
- Creates atmospheric depth without overwhelming

Content Contrast:
- All text and UI elements have sufficient contrast against overlay
- Text primary is off-white (high contrast)
- Surfaces are solid colors (no transparency issues)
- Borders are subtle but visible
- Icons are clear and readable

Background as Atmosphere:
- Background is present but not dominant
- It sets mood and atmosphere
- Content remains the focus
- Background doesn't animate dramatically
- Subtle parallax only, very slow

CONSISTENT ALIGNMENT
--------------------
Alignment Rules:
- Text: Left-aligned (except center for displays like timer)
- Headings: Left-aligned
- Buttons: Center-aligned text, full width or auto
- Icons: Center-aligned in containers
- Cards: Left-aligned content, consistent margins

Grid System:
- 8px base unit for all spacing
- Elements align to grid
- Consistent margins and padding
- Visual harmony through alignment

HIERARCHY
---------
Visual Hierarchy:
- Size: Larger = more important (timer numbers, headings)
- Weight: Bolder = more important (headings use medium/semibold)
- Color: Accent = interactive/important (buttons, active states)
- Spacing: More space = more important (sections separated)
- Position: Top/center = more important (timer display)

Typography Hierarchy:
- Display XL: Timer numbers, hero text
- Heading 1: Panel titles
- Heading 2: Section headers
- Body: Standard content
- Caption: Metadata, hints

NEGATIVE SPACE
--------------
Negative space is a design element:
- Empty areas are intentional, not wasted
- Space creates focus and calm
- Don't fill every available pixel
- Let content breathe
- Space guides the eye

BADGES, TAGS, AND CHIPS
------------------------
Badge (for counts, status):
- Background: Accent secondary at 20% opacity
- Text: Accent secondary (full opacity)
- Size: 20px height, auto width
- Padding: 4px 8px
- Border Radius: 10px (pill)
- Font: Regular (400), 11px
- Position: Top-right of parent (for counts)

Tag (for labels):
- Background: Accent secondary at 20% opacity
- Text: Accent secondary (full opacity)
- Size: 24px height, auto width
- Padding: 6px 12px
- Border Radius: 12px
- Font: Regular (400), 12px
- Multiple tags can appear together

Chip (for selections):
- Background: Secondary surface (default), accent primary (active)
- Text: Text secondary (default), white (active)
- Size: 32px height, auto width
- Padding: 8px 16px
- Border Radius: 16px (pill)
- Font: Medium (500), 14px
- Interactive, clickable

All maintain zen tone: muted colors, subtle backgrounds, clean typography, 
appropriate sizing.


SECTION 6: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FRONT-END)
================================================================================

SEMANTIC MARKUP
---------------
HTML Structure:
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (nav, main, section, article, header, footer)
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
- ARIA labels for icon-only buttons
- Form labels properly associated with inputs
- Landmark regions for screen readers

Example Panel Structure:
<article role="dialog" aria-labelledby="panel-title">
  <header>
    <h2 id="panel-title">Panel Title</h2>
    <button aria-label="Close panel">X</button>
  </header>
  <main>
    <!-- Panel content -->
  </main>
</article>

CSS ARCHITECTURE
----------------
Approach: Utility-first with component classes
- Use Tailwind CSS for utilities (spacing, colors, typography)
- Create component classes for complex patterns (panels, buttons, cards)
- Use CSS custom properties for design tokens
- Organize by component, not by property

File Structure:
- globals.css: Base styles, design tokens, component classes
- components/: Component-specific styles (if needed)
- Tailwind config: Design tokens, custom colors, spacing

Design Tokens (CSS Custom Properties):
:root {
  --color-surface-primary: rgb(20, 25, 35);
  --color-surface-secondary: rgb(30, 38, 50);
  --color-surface-tertiary: rgb(40, 50, 65);
  --color-accent-primary: rgb(100, 150, 200);
  --color-accent-secondary: rgb(120, 180, 200);
  --color-text-primary: rgb(240, 245, 250);
  --color-text-secondary: rgb(180, 190, 200);
  --color-text-tertiary: rgb(120, 130, 140);
  --color-border: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  --spacing-base: 8px;
  --radius-sm: 4px;
  --radius-md: 8px;
  --radius-lg: 12px;
  --radius-xl: 16px;
  --shadow-1: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  --shadow-2: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
  --shadow-3: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
  --transition-base: 200ms ease-out;
  --transition-slow: 300ms ease-out;
}

MODERN LAYOUT STRATEGIES
------------------------
Flexbox for component layout:
- Use flex for one-dimensional layouts (rows, columns)
- Gap property for spacing (no margins between flex items)
- Align-items and justify-content for alignment

Grid for complex layouts:
- Use grid for two-dimensional layouts (forms, card grids)
- Gap property for spacing
- Auto-fit/auto-fill for responsive grids

Positioning:
- Fixed for sidebar, header, footer
- Absolute for overlays, tooltips
- Relative for positioned children
- Sticky for scrollable headers (if needed)

LAYERING CYBERCITY BACKGROUND
------------------------------
HTML Structure:
<div class="background-container">
  <div class="background-image"></div>
  <div class="background-overlay"></div>
</div>
<div class="content-container">
  <!-- All UI content -->
</div>

CSS Implementation:
.background-container {
  position: fixed;
  inset: 0;
  z-index: 0;
}

.background-image {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background-image: url('/assets/images/backgrounds/cybercity.jpg');
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  /* Parallax effect via transform on scroll */
}

.background-overlay {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background: linear-gradient(
    to bottom,
    rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 0%,
    rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4) 100%
  );
}

.content-container {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 10;
  /* All UI elements */
}

Parallax Implementation (JavaScript):
- Listen to scroll events (if any scrolling)
- Apply transform to background-image
- Move at 0.5x speed: transform: translateY(scrollY * 0.5)
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
- Throttle scroll events for performance

RESPONSIVE CONSIDERATIONS
-------------------------
Desktop/Laptop Focus:
- Minimum width: 1280px (optimized for)
- Maximum content width: 1400px (center larger content)
- Sidebar: Fixed 80px width
- Panels: Max 600px width (standard), 800px (wide)
- Typography scales appropriately

Breakpoints (if needed for smaller laptops):
- Large: 1440px and above
- Medium: 1280px to 1439px
- Small: 1024px to 1279px (minimum supported)

Component Behavior:
- Panels remain centered or draggable
- Sidebar stays fixed
- Typography may scale down slightly
- Spacing remains generous


SECTION 7: ACCESSIBILITY & USABILITY
================================================================================

CONTRAST GUIDANCE
-----------------
Text Contrast:
- Text primary on dark background: WCAG AAA (7:1 ratio minimum)
- Text secondary: WCAG AA (4.5:1 ratio minimum)
- Text tertiary: WCAG AA for large text (3:1 ratio)
- Accent colors on dark: WCAG AA minimum

Interactive Elements:
- Buttons: High contrast text (white on accent)
- Inputs: Clear borders, sufficient contrast
- Focus indicators: 2px outline, 50% opacity accent color
- Hover states: Visible change (5-10% lightness shift)

Color Independence:
- Never rely solely on color to convey information
- Use icons, text, or patterns in addition to color
- Status indicators use both color and icon/text

KEYBOARD ACCESSIBILITY
----------------------
Focus Management:
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Tab order follows visual order (logical flow)
- Focus indicators are clearly visible (2px outline)

- Tab: Move focus forward
- Shift+Tab: Move focus backward
- Arrow keys: Navigate lists, select options
- Space: Toggle checkboxes, activate buttons

Skip Links:
- Skip to main content link (first focusable element)
- Hidden until focused
- Appears on top-left when focused

FOCUS INDICATORS
----------------
Focus Style:
- Outline: 2px solid, accent primary at 50% opacity
- Outline offset: 2px (creates gap from element)
- No border change (outline is separate)
- Visible on all interactive elements
- Consistent across all components

Focus Visibility:
- Always visible when keyboard navigating
- Can be hidden for mouse users (optional, but not recommended)
- High contrast for visibility

MOTION SENSITIVITY
------------------
Respect prefers-reduced-motion:
- Check media query: @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)
- Disable animations for users who prefer reduced motion
- Keep essential functionality without animation
- Transitions can be instant (0ms) for reduced motion

Animation Guidelines:
- No auto-playing animations
- No flashing or strobing effects
- Animations are subtle and slow
- Users can pause/stop animations
- Parallax can be disabled for reduced motion

FIRST-TIME USER EXPERIENCE
---------------------------
Clear Visual Hierarchy:

- Can be dismissed and skipped
- Non-intrusive, doesn't block interface

Feedback:
- Clear feedback for all actions
- Button states show what will happen
- Success/error messages are clear
- Loading states for async operations

UNDERSTANDABILITY
-----------------
Clear Labels:

- Show validation errors clearly
- Prevent accidental data loss

Help and Documentation:
- Tooltips provide context
- Empty states suggest actions
- Error messages suggest solutions
- Optional help section in settings


================================================================================
END OF DESIGN SYSTEM SPECIFICATION
================================================================================

This specification provides a complete foundation for implementing a Japanese 
zen-inspired interface that harmonizes with the cybercity background while 
maintaining calm, focused usability. All components, interactions, and visual 
elements work together as a unified system that feels polished, cohesive, and 
aesthetically aligned.
